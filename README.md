## lean_corelib

Starting spot for the llm to expand.

"core" because this is the core data structures for math. Not because anyone should use or depend on this.
Renamed from Mathlib as a thin veil to help push the llm away from duplicating Mathlib.

This is a subset of Mathlib master@#9837ca9 (v4.15.0)
