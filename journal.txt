- Added branch target deduping by adding CGResults

- It successfully edited Test.lean (proving, much to my amusement, that the git diff works)

- Also added transient state resetting (I finally had a graph crash (I wrote a bad panic))

I installed flashinfer and everything got Significantlty slower. Deleting it and clearing the cache didn't work. I think it installed itself somewhere that vllm is finding.. not sure. Signing off.

Today, I spent my evening working on manually creating nodes, favoriting them, terminating trees, and labeling them.

Importantly, I got a successful BT! I had to teach it ed. But this worked for the simple succ_pred_two goal.
```
<think>
The new test added to Test.lean is very similar to the previous test. It also looks like succ_pred_one is the proof for that proof. I should duplicate succ_pred_one and create succ_pred_two (even though the naming is confusing... maybe succ_pred_not_two would be better. Lets wait on that). I will append it to the end of the file so I don't remove succ_pred_one
</think>
<actions>
<ed>
e Corelib/Data/Nat/Basic.lean
a
theorem succ_pred_two (n : ℕ) : n ≠ 0 ∧ n ≠ 2 → succ (pred n) = n := by
  intro hn
  cases n with
  | zero => exact absurd rfl (And.left hn)
  | succ n => rw [Nat.pred_succ]
.
w
</ed>
</actions>
```

I have saved this graph in testgraphs/first_succ.json

First time I am recording my results. Hoping this will work as a sort of diary / journal that I can reference in order to perform more-efficient hyperparameter optimization.

Today, I ran:
- unsloth/llama-3-70b-bnb-4bit
- unsloth/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-bnb-4bit
- unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B-bnb-4bit

Observations:
- llama-3-70b was terrible
- R1-Distill didn't understand ed. It was close to understanding the problem
- 3.3-I got incredibly close to solving the goal with:
```
cat << 'EOF' | ed

a
-Corelib/Data/Nat/Basic.lean
open Nat
theorem succ_pred_one (n : ℕ) : n ≠ 0 ∧ n ≠ 1 → succ (pred n) = n := by
  intro hn
  cases n with
  | zero => exact absurd rfl (And.left hn)
  | succ n => rw [Nat.pred_succ]
theorem succ_pred_two (n : ℕ) : n ≠ 0 ∧ n ≠ 2 → succ (pred n) = n := by
  intro hn
  cases n with
  | zero => exact absurd rfl (And.left hn)
  | succ n => rw [Nat.pred_succ]

w Corelib/Data/Nat/Basic.lean

EOF
```
This is, unfortunately, not valid ed. But I checked, succ_pred_two would have worked perfectly if the model had understood ed better.

- I added some IMPORTANT HINTS to the goal. This helped a ton. I am worried they are slightly too hardcoded, but I suspect that once I have a lora adapter layer on this, it will understand the problem a lot better.
- It is really strange that it doesn't know any ed syntax. I suspect as the models get further from being trained on the internet (distil), they forget everything in those classes of information.
    - To remedy this, I suggest that I will have to:
        1. swap to a bigger model (possibly 405B-I) (or maybe deepseek R1 671B) (depending on how they fit with lambda-labs instance sizes) 
        2. manually teach it ed via manually-edited samples

- 405b @ q4 should fit inside "4x H100 (80 GB SXM5)" But that is probably a pretty hot commodity. Will have to fight to get instances.
(and even then, it will be very close. Not sure.)

- I think git diff should output in ed format. 
    - Actually, no I dont. The problem with that is that it would collapse line deletions into `d` commands instead of informing the model that it removed important things like an import
