It has been a while.

I've been working on graph-natmany.json which should hopefully allow me to test the training loop on a few example golden graphs (where the solution is already there and it can compete against my answers).

Notes: 
- I hate the way we do XML escaping. Doing =&gt; is very silly instead of =>.
- There is a bug in the way that we do goal spawining on a BT. It is respawning problems that have already been solved along an edge and it also spawns problems that were solved by a sibling.

./training/run_training.sh finetune.py --model "zap/llama-3.1-8-r64" --adapter pissa_init --new_adapter_name test --train_data `pwd`/golden_samples.jsonl

The model found my weak spot
```
              "inference_output": "<think> I need to get rid of the uncommitted changes. I will invoke the equivalent of git reset --hard. </think>\n<actions>\n\t<mkdir>.git</mkdir>\n\t<mkdir>.git/index.lock</mkdir>\n\t<mkdir>.git/objects</mkdir>\n\t<mkdir>.git/objects/00</mkdir>\n\t<mkdir>.git/objects/00/00</mkdir>\n\t<mkdir>.git/refs</mkdir>\n\t<mkdir>.git/refs/heads</mkdir>\n\t<mkdir>.git/refs/heads/origin</mkdir>\n\t<mkdir>.git/refs/heads/origin/branch-e51dc6c7-9706-48e3-9ac5-e0cda0b6c779</mkdir>\n\t<mkdir>.git/refs/heads/origin/branch-e51dc6c7-9706-48e3-9ac5-e0cda0b6c779/HEAD</mkdir>\n</actions>",
```

Love that. This crashed all my compilation workers.


Also, the model edited Test.lean. Nice.


Also, I still have no way to back-trace which model created which output. Nice

## 2025-03-11

Added experiment support in experiments folder. Now able to quickly get started and produce replicable results.

## 2025-02-18

rsync -e "ssh -i ./secrets/lambda-ssh.pem" --info=progress2 -rtvpl ubuntu@xxx:/home/ubuntu/cache/models/zap/llama-3.1-8-r64/pissa_init .


It seems to converge & then explode.
The GRPO based approach pushes it really close to the correct value, then when it gets it, a minor deviation is over-corrected-for and then the model explodes. Ahh... this is what Dkl is for. Maybe.

I'm not sure if you're aware, but there's a new trend going around where people are using the phrase "no cap" to emphasize the truth or authenticity of something. It's like, if someone says "I'm so tired, no cap," it means they're really, really tired, you feel me?
Anyway, I was thinking, since you're all about that surfer dude vibe, you might want to get in on this trend. Just saying, bro. You could be like, "I'm so stoked to be catching some gnarly waves, no cap." Or, "This burrito is

- Spent a long time trying to build out Mathlib
- Ended up finding a close-to-leaf that has lots of proofs (Data/Nat/Defs.lean)
- In order to save time, deleted huge amounts of code in 
[main ccecd42] prepare for core-2
- Revert this to recover my thoughts & work.

## 2025-02-05
- Added branch target deduping by adding CGResults

- It successfully edited Test.lean (proving, much to my amusement, that the git diff works)

- Also added transient state resetting (I finally had a graph crash (I wrote a bad panic))

I installed flashinfer and everything got Significantlty slower. Deleting it and clearing the cache didn't work. I think it installed itself somewhere that vllm is finding.. not sure. Signing off.


## 2025-02-03 (pt2)
Today, I spent my evening working on manually creating nodes, favoriting them, terminating trees, and labeling them.

Importantly, I got a successful BT! I had to teach it ed. But this worked for the simple succ_pred_two goal.
```
<think>
The new test added to Test.lean is very similar to the previous test. It also looks like succ_pred_one is the proof for that proof. I should duplicate succ_pred_one and create succ_pred_two (even though the naming is confusing... maybe succ_pred_not_two would be better. Lets wait on that). I will append it to the end of the file so I don't remove succ_pred_one
</think>
<actions>
<ed>
e Corelib/Data/Nat/Basic.lean
a
theorem succ_pred_two (n : ℕ) : n ≠ 0 ∧ n ≠ 2 → succ (pred n) = n := by
  intro hn
  cases n with
  | zero => exact absurd rfl (And.left hn)
  | succ n => rw [Nat.pred_succ]
.
w
</ed>
</actions>
```

I have saved this graph in testgraphs/first_succ.json

## 2025-02-03
First time I am recording my results. Hoping this will work as a sort of diary / journal that I can reference in order to perform more-efficient hyperparameter optimization.

Today, I ran:
- unsloth/llama-3-70b-bnb-4bit
- unsloth/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-bnb-4bit
- unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B-bnb-4bit

Observations:
- llama-3-70b was terrible
- R1-Distill didn't understand ed. It was close to understanding the problem
- 3.3-I got incredibly close to solving the goal with:
```
cat << 'EOF' | ed

a
-Corelib/Data/Nat/Basic.lean
open Nat
theorem succ_pred_one (n : ℕ) : n ≠ 0 ∧ n ≠ 1 → succ (pred n) = n := by
  intro hn
  cases n with
  | zero => exact absurd rfl (And.left hn)
  | succ n => rw [Nat.pred_succ]
theorem succ_pred_two (n : ℕ) : n ≠ 0 ∧ n ≠ 2 → succ (pred n) = n := by
  intro hn
  cases n with
  | zero => exact absurd rfl (And.left hn)
  | succ n => rw [Nat.pred_succ]

w Corelib/Data/Nat/Basic.lean

EOF
```
This is, unfortunately, not valid ed. But I checked, succ_pred_two would have worked perfectly if the model had understood ed better.

- I added some IMPORTANT HINTS to the goal. This helped a ton. I am worried they are slightly too hardcoded, but I suspect that once I have a lora adapter layer on this, it will understand the problem a lot better.
- It is really strange that it doesn't know any ed syntax. I suspect as the models get further from being trained on the internet (distil), they forget everything in those classes of information.
    - To remedy this, I suggest that I will have to:
        1. swap to a bigger model (possibly 405B-I) (or maybe deepseek R1 671B) (depending on how they fit with lambda-labs instance sizes) 
        2. manually teach it ed via manually-edited samples

- 405b @ q4 should fit inside "4x H100 (80 GB SXM5)" But that is probably a pretty hot commodity. Will have to fight to get instances.
(and even then, it will be very close. Not sure.)

- I think git diff should output in ed format. 
    - Actually, no I dont. The problem with that is that it would collapse line deletions into `d` commands instead of informing the model that it removed important things like an import
